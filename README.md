## Core Gameplay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Survive** a long, challanging, resource-scarce journey back to the main road, after getting lost
in the woods on a rainy night. **Forage** for wood, berries, water and vines. **Hunt**, **fish**, **rest**, **cook** and **craft** campfires, weapons, traps, bandages and clothing insulators. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Travel**, take different turns and make **strategic** choices in order to reach civilization before it is too late. Balance **hunger, temperature, thirst, health** and inventory to avoid **starvation,
hypothermia, dehydration*** and **illness**. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay alive or **permanently lose** the game and start over!
